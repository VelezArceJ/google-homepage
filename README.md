This is the beginning of journey on THE ODIN PROJECT. Although this page should be about what I am supposed to make, I instead have decided to express my goals. I want to be great enough to provide for my family. I want to be a great father. After college, I decided to become a chef for me. But now that I have a daughter, I want to be better for her. I want to be around. I want to be great.
